1. uninitialize the repository using command {rm -rf .git} in gitbash (not in terminal/powershell), this helps to sort out problems in vscode source control git.
2. {git help git} in git bash shows all the commands and whatare they used for.
3. sometimes when you try to push files from local repo to remote one then you cant push as a result of mismatched head between repos.so you need to pull the remote repo which will then solve the problem.
4. pull is always combination of (fetch+ merge)
